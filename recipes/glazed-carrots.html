    <p>For all my vegetarian folks out there who aren't vegan.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cook this if you don't like meaty things or want to watch your health somewhat but not too much (the ingredients include butter after all). I like the simplicity of this recipe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots: Look for firm, plump, bright, and smooth carrots.</li>

        <li>Butter: You'll need about Â¼ cup butter to make these caramelized carrots.</li>
            
        <li>Brown sugar: You can use light or dark brown sugar.</li>
            
        <li>Seasonings: These glazed carrots are simply seasoned with salt and ground white pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If you're ready to cook, here's how you do it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the carrots: Place the peeled and cut carrots in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots are tender. Drain.</li>

        <li>Glaze the carrots: Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the sugar, salt, and pepper. Add carrots and toss until well-coated.</li>
    
        <li>Put in an air-tight container once the carrots have cooled and store in the frigde for up to four days.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>How to Make Spag Bolognese My Way</h1>
    <p>I don't have a photo for it but here's an image of what it should approximately look like:</p>

    <p>That is a picture of spaghetti bolognese right there, mouth-watering.</p>
    <br><!--this is a line break-->
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> I like to make this dish every now and then whenever I crave some minced beef immersed in tomato sauce and a bunch of spices, I make a pot of it that ends up lasting for a few days.</p>
    <p>It doesn't get old in that short of a span though so unless you're not a big fan of fatty or meaty foods you'll probably feel the same way about this recipe.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 packs of minced beef from the store, enough to fit in a medium-large pot.</li>
        <li>Cooking oil of some sort (I use peanut oil because it's what I've got).</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Fresh ingredients like onions if you know your way around fresh produce.</li>
        <li>Store-bought seasonings of your preference (I use garlic powder, black pepper, and "italian seasoning").</li>
        <li>Store-bought tomato sauce (I use meat-flavored Prego sauce for the extra-meaty taste).</li>
        <li>Something to stir and break up the frozen meat with.</li>
        <li>Taste-testing tool like a spoon.</li>
        <li>Noodles of your preference, they don't have to be spaghetti to go well with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Strainer to separate noodles from the water.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If you're ready to cook, here's how you do it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat the bottom of your pot with a bit of cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Put the meat inside and let it heat up until you can break it apart.</li>
        <li>Add in your fresh produce if you wish to enhance the taste.</li>
        <li>Cook the meat until most of the water has boiled off but watch out for the moment when the oils come out, you want those in the meat.</li>
        <li>Dump the tomato sauce into the pot and stir until it begins bubbling.</li>
        <li>At this point you can start adding the spices you desire, taste-test to tune the sauce to your liking.</li>
        <li>Once you've tuned the sauce, it's time to boil some water in a separate pot for your noodles.</li>
        <li>Fill the pot a bit so that the noodles will be immersed in the water and cook evenly but not displace too much water once they're all in.</li>
        <li>Wait for the water to boil before adding the noodles, stir them regularly and taste a noodle to gauge their consistency to avoid finishing too early or too late.</li>
        <li>Put your strainer in a sink and dump the pot of noodles into it to separate noodles from water.</li>
        <li>Get a plate and silverware and enjoy your delicious meal.</li>
    </ol>
